# epl
R package to implement the ExplodeLayout algorithm.

For test purpose, we currently has provided a 'test_data.RData' file for users to 
download and test. It's a unipartite network containing 115 vertices.

We suggest installing the package in the following way:


`install.packages("devtools")`

`devtools::install_github("UTMB-DIVA-Lab/epl")`

That's it, the epl packages is installed now. Just load it:

`library(epl)`

and then read the documentation carefully:

`?epl`

The package currently includes three functions: 'dataConvert', 'search' and 'visualize'. Please read the documentation carefully before you use them.
